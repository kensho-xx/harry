Suggestions:
   * to work on project create following dir
        harry_project   (let's call it HARRY_DEV_HOME)
	`-- harry_repo  (the repository: HARRY_DEV_REPO (this part is placed on GitHub))

   * don't keep your libs in repository, keep them in $HARRY_DEV_HOME/libs dir.
     (you've received mail with link to libraries - download them and
      extract in $HARRY_DEV_HOME/libs)

   * hope you have mysql and ant... :( ... if not:
     $> sudo apt-get install mysql
     $> sudo apt-get install ant

   * to just run the example please follow this steps:
     1) as your mysql root create 'admin' user with password: 'admin'
     2) create schema 'test_harry'
     3) add all privilleges on 'test_harry' to 'admin' user

     In you're terminal mysql client call:
     mysql>
	create database test_harry;
        grant all on test_harry.* to 'admin'@'localhost';
	grant all on test_harry.* to 'admin'@'%'

   * run example:
     $> ant run.standalone.client
